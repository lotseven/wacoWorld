staticbody2d object with staticbodydetection extended

it will need an exported packedscene to switch to

can be anything of your choosing, but should extend switchedOnMode
if you redo ready, need to .ready() in the new ready to do the super-class version of ready before
you do your other readying shit

new object is passed a location and rotation and scale

ALSO, WHEN IT ATTACHES TO THE HITBOX, IT INHERITS THE OFFSET. HOW TO MAKE IT NOT DO THIS?
