staticbody2d object with staticbodydetection extended

it will need an exported packedscene to switch to (drag n drop onto inspector where it says switchTo)

can be anything of your choosing, but must extend switchedOnMode
if you redo ready, need to super._ready() in the new ready to do the super-class version of ready before
you do your other readying shit

however if you dont want to switch from a staticbody to a rigidbody, which would be pretty understandable to be honest
you can just extend genpurposemagnatable on whatever you want to magnetable-ify. no switching 
between objects. ready() function is important, so don't overwrite or super._ready() if you do. 
genPurposeMagnetable extends RigidBody2D, so anything with that hitbox can be used.

if you want a rigidbody to respond to more than 1 magnet, rewrite the groupingHasChanged function (which triggers on the signal in SignalBus)
